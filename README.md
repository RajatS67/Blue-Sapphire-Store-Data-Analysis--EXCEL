# Blue-Sapphire-Store-Data-Analysis--EXCEL

In this project we have created an annual report sales dashboard for Blue Sapphire Store for the year 2022, moreover, we will analyze the patterns to grow in year 2023 by seeing/solving certain questions like:

1) We will compare sales and orders using a single chart
2) Analyze which month had highest sales
3) Who purchased more good: MEN or Women
4) The status of the order in 2022
5) Top 5 states according to sales contribution
6) The relation between AGE and Gender
7) Which online channel has the minimum sales
8) AND the highest selling category of goods

INSIGHTS/ANSWERS that we get from the analysis are:
1) Women are more likely to buy as compared to men ~ 65%
2) Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states in sales contribution ~ 35%
3) Adult age group (30-49 years) is the maximum contributor in sales ~ 50%
4) Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing ~ 80%

FINAL CONCLUSION TO IMPROVE BLUE SAPPHIRE STORE SALES:
Target WOMEN customers of age group (30-49 years) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
